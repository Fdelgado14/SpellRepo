\f0\fs24 \cf0 Add one Quartz crystal inside a large, deep pan. Then from there add 1 liter of white candle wax to the pan and stir for a bit. Heat up the pan and then add a copper item into the pan. Once the copper item has heated up along with everything else in the pan, add an amethyst crystal. Let the crystal heat up as well and once that has happened add the cinnamon and sugar for the final step. Let everything cool off and once it has, gently apply the potion onto the lid of your eyes. Wait 5 minutes for the effects to kick in, and once they do you will be able to see colors that no ordinary human eyes are able to perceive.}
